Recruitment shouldn’t start with keywords. It should start with the problem you need solved.

BRIX makes this shift possible, powered by **960M+ verified profiles** and trusted by companies like **DJI, Pika, and Instacart**.

Traditional hiring models of posting jobs, collecting resumes, screening, and interviewing were designed for another era. They are **misaligned with modern hiring challenges**: fragmented data, heavy manual workload, and weak signals about candidate fit.

These models may optimize efficiency in the short term, but they fail to provide a **strategic hiring advantage**.

With BRIX, hiring becomes not only faster but also **anticipatory**. The system predicts talent needs, surfaces hidden matches, and compounds insights with every search. In this way, hiring turns into a **compounding asset**, rather than a recurring cost.

LinkedIn is a search tool.\
**BRIX is a path from Problem to Talent.**

## A new hiring paradigm: Problem → Talent

Hiring should follow a clear, continuous path.

From a business problem straight to the right talent.

## Seven steps of the new path

<Steps>
