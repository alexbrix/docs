Recruitment shouldn’t start with keywords. It should start with the problem you need solved.

BRIX makes this shift possible, powered by **960M\+ verified profiles** and trusted by companies like **DJI, Pika, and Instacart**.

Traditional hiring models of posting jobs, collecting resumes, screening, and interviewing were designed for another era. They are **misaligned with modern hiring challenges**: fragmented data, heavy manual workload, and weak signals about candidate fit.

These models may optimize efficiency in the short term, but they fail to provide a **strategic hiring advantage**.

With BRIX, hiring becomes not only faster but also **anticipatory**. The system predicts talent needs, surfaces hidden matches, and compounds insights with every search. In this way, hiring turns into a **compounding asset**, rather than a recurring cost.

## The limits of traditional HR tools

Over the past decade, platforms like LinkedIn Recruiter have expanded access to candidates and improved search efficiency. But structural gaps remain:

- **Limited starting point**. Searches often begin with keywords and filters instead of the actual business problem.
- **High manual workload**. Recruiters still spend hours sending InMails and chasing responses.
- **Focus on volume, not fit**. Hundreds of profiles may appear, but only a handful are truly interview-ready.
- **No refinement or cumulative learning**. Each search starts from scratch with little ability to improve over time.
- **Weak data-sharing and insight retention**. Fragmented information across platforms makes it difficult to build institutional knowledge.

These gaps show that while traditional tools raise efficiency, they fail to turn hiring into a **strategic, compounding advantage**. BRIX fills these gaps with self-improving AI, continuous learning, and direct delivery of verified talent.
