Recruitment has existed for thousands of years.\
The process has barely changed: **post a job → collect resumes → screen → interview.**

Today, this model can no longer keep pace with the speed of business.\
Because the real need is not to _fill a role_.\
It is: **when a business problem arises, to find the person who can solve it.**

## The limits of traditional HR tools

Over the last decade, LinkedIn Recruiter and similar platforms have become industry standards.\
They expanded the talent pool and improved search efficiency—but core challenges remain:

- **Wrong starting point**: everything begins with keywords, not business problems.
- **Heavy manual work**: recruiters still search and reach out one by one.
- **Volume over substance**: hundreds of profiles appear, but only a few are truly interview-ready.
- **No memory**: each new search starts from scratch; experience and data do not carry forward.

> These tools raise efficiency, but they don’t fix the **fragmented, high-cost nature** of hiring.

## A new hiring paradigm: **Problem → Talent**

Hiring should be a **clear, continuous, and repeatable path**.\
From a **business problem straight to the right talent.**

## Six steps of the new path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Problem | Hiring starts with the business problem, not a keyword search.">
    **Before:** business needs are vague; HR must translate them into JDs through back-and-forth.\
    **Now:** the problem itself can trigger recruitment, with AI breaking it into actionable requirements.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Demand | AI understands the role and learns from each hire.">
    **Before:** every JD is written from scratch, often misaligned with how the team really works.\
    **Now:** the system adapts to your hiring habits, refining accuracy over time.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate | Pinpoint candidates across a unified global pool.">
    **Before:** data scattered across platforms and vendors; inconsistent quality, outdated info, missing contacts.\
    **Now:** BRIX provides **960M\+ verified profiles**, with direct contact details, covering 100\+ countries and core industries.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect | Automated engagement, round the clock.">
    **Before:** recruiters send InMails one by one, then wait—follow-ups take days.\
    **Now:** the Agent runs **multi-channel outreach** (email, InMail, calls), 24/7, until candidates respond.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify | Screening and feedback integration.">
    **Before:** days spent filtering resumes; most are rejected after interviews.\
    **Now:** AI pre-screens fit, absorbs interview feedback, and **dynamically ranks candidates**—each round gets smarter.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Talent | Delivery of a shortlist, not a database dump.">
    **Before:** results are a stack of resumes that still require manual work.\
    **Now:** BRIX delivers a **curated shortlist of vetted candidates**, interview-ready, while building a reusable talent asset for the future.

## Hiring Tools vs. Hiring Paradigm

| Stage        | LinkedIn Recruiter                   | BRIX AI Recruiter                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Kick-off** | Starts with keywords and filters     | Starts with a business problem                |
| **Locate**   | Data scattered, inconsistent quality | Unified pool of 960M\+ verified, contactable  |
| **Connect**  | One-to-one InMails, long waits       | Automated, multi-channel, 24/7 follow-up      |
| **Verify**   | Manual resume screening              | AI pre-screens, integrates interview feedback |
| **Deliver**  | Dozens or hundreds of resumes        | Curated Shortlist of vetted candidates        |
| **Reuse**    | Each search starts over              | Each search compounds into the next           |

LinkedIn is a search tool.\
BRIX is a path from Problem to Talent.

## Redefining hiring

Hiring is no longer about filling roles.\
It is about **matching business problems with the people who can solve them.**

Hiring is no longer a cost.\
It becomes an **asset**, repeatable, scalable, and compounding with every search.

This is not another tool.\
**This is the new standard: Problem → Talent.**
